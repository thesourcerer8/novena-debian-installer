 - Add a script at the end to remove the kogasi repos. 
 The code:
 
 in-target grep -v "novena" /etc/apt/sources.list > /etc/apt/sources.list.new ; 
 
 should work, but does not for some reason
 
 - As of now, mkimage only worked when the linux-image is reinstalled, not on any update-initramfs. The default initramfs is stored at /usr/share/linux-novena, but I cannot get the system to recognise that (it thinks it is at /boot)
 
 - The hooks are not merged with novena-debian-support. Once that happens, we can remove them from here.
 
 - u-boot does not update when u-boot-novena is updated, only when linux-image-novena is upgraded or reinstalled
